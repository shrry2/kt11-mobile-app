# kt11-mobile-app
This project aims to build an mobile client to access kt11.me stressfully from mobile devices. This currently uses Expo and React Native as the framework of the app though it may be changed in the future.

# Conributions and your rights
Anyone can contribute to making the app better by writing some code and sending pull requests, but no one can insist their commercial rights. The commercial rights and the trademark right are held by me, so if you want to build your own client, you need to choose another name.

# Accessing the API
Since the API structure is not public, you have to assume from the code I wrote. It might be document in the future if my motivation continues.
